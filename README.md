# The Helsinki Discrete Element Model (HiDEM) #

Developers: Jan Åström & Joe Todd

This is HiDEM, the Helsinki Discrete Element Model, a particle model for simulating elastic behaviour, fracture and calving at marine terminating glaciers. Due to its computational demands, this code is designed to be run on parallel HPC facilities.

See the model in action [here](https://youtu.be/owUrbm_3zi0) and [here](https://youtu.be/wXMK0e2isM4).

The model physics is described in detail in [Åström et al. 2013](https://www.the-cryosphere.net/7/1591/2013/).

## Compilation ##

Configuration, compilation and installation is handled by CMake. Example installation scripts for Cray and Ubuntu systems are located in scripts/compilation. These scripts invoke cmake with toolchain files located in scripts/toolchains, which set default compilers etc.

By default, compilation produces a single binary 'HiDEM' in the top level of the 'build' directory.

If you generate your own toolchain/compilation scripts for different systems, please get in touch or make a pull request!

## Input Files ##

On starting, HiDEM reads the name of an input file from HIDEM\_STARTINFO (e.g. 'inp.dat').

inp.dat - defines various parameters for the simulation

The user must also supply the initial geometry in gridded format: X,Y,SURF,BASE,BED,FRICTION

This initial geometry file is specified in the input file as 'Geometry File':

`Geometry File = "mass3.dat"`

Head of a sample mass3.dat file:

```

```

See more information in section 'Geometry File' 

Note: To avoid spurious single particles appearing at the edge of the domain, interpolation of 
particle locations is not permitted where not all 4 supporting points have valid surface and bed
values. To permit this, set `	    Strict Domain Interpolation = False` in inp.dat.

## Important Points ##

#### Typical simulation domains: ####

* 100m x 100m * 100m - typical particle size 2-10m
* 100km x 100km * 1km - typical particle size 30-100m

#### Boundary conditions: ####

* Domain in x-y plane
* Main flow in y-direction
* Forces acting on edge should be defined

#### Particle size: ####

* Should have at least 10 particles in thickness direction (preferably 20-30).
* Maximum ~10 million particles
* Max timestep size scales with particle size:
  * Too long timestep => instability
  * Too short timestep => long execution times
  

## Getting data ready ##

Replace no data with zero

Adjust the waterline (lowest point in domain must be non-negative)

Choose the number of cores

Do something to the restitution coefficient

Point to the input file (e.g. testinp.dat) using HIDEM_STARTINFO

## Test Case ##

A test case is provided in the `test` directory. This is a simple rectangular domain with a sloping upper surface. This simulation will produce fracturing behaviour within a 6 hour simulation on 130 CPUs. The user should edit `example.job` to provide a valid PBS budget account, and the correct number of nodes and cores (currently 6, 130) depending on system architecture (cores per node).

The behaviour of the test case can be changed by modifying `Max Load` and `Friction Scale` in inp.dat.

## Running the model ##

The model runs in parallel using MPI, so the simulation should be started using `mpirun` or `aprun`:

```
mpirun -n 70 HiDEM
```

An example PBS job script is provided in example.job

The user may specify a run name which is preprended on all output files:

`Run Name = Example_Simulation`

#### Restarting ####

It is possible to restart one run from another:

`Restart = 1`

If the run name has changed, specify the run from which to restart:

```
Run Name = Example_Simulation_Part2
Restart from Run Name = Example_Simulation
```

## Melange ##

It is possible to use HiDEM to investigate glacier/melange interaction. Melange is generated by running an initial 'melange simulation' until the domain calves to produce icebergs & brash. Then a subsequent simulation can read in this broken ice from the 'melange simulation'. This is controlled by the keyword:

```
Melange Run Name = "Your_previous_simulation_run_name"
```

The 'melange simulation' setup could be identical to the standard calving simulation, or one could choose to increase the porosity or lower the maximum load to encourage breakup. It is not necessary for the melange simulation and the subsequent simulation to run on the same number of cores, but it is expected that the particle size (SCL) would be the same.

Note: unlike a regular simulation restart, the melange is assumed to be 'at rest' when read into the new sim.

## Troubleshooting ##

If the simulation [explodes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZIixgvlF8U) (particles moving too far):

* Set a higher `Translational Damping` or `Rotational Damping` in the input file - multiply by two? Very high values for damping might be e.g. 16E4 and 8E4

* Set `Fracture After Time = 50.0` or so, to allow the simulation to settle before permitting fracture

* Change `friction scale` in input - this scales the bed friction

* Change the `timestep`

* Smooth gradients in basal friction or geometry (in `geometry file`)

* Kill all motion every x timesteps

### Geometry file ####

The geometry file contains the input configuration, in format:

x, y, surface, base, bed, friction, geom_mask (optional)

x and y must be gridded and start at zero, must have a (0,0) corner.  

Friction has units of Newton seconds per metre

output transformation matrix which takes from Elmer domain to HiDEM domain.  

make sure the bed is buffered beyond the edge of the ice, and define these regions by setting surf and base equal to bed.  

User may optionally specify a 'geom_mask' column in geometry input file, which tells the model which regions are ice (=1), fjord (=2), bedrock(=0). This is required for imposing lateral boundary conditions (Fixed Lateral Margins).

## Model Output ##

HiDEM produces data relating to *particles* and inter-particle *bonds*. Particle information is written to .vtu files (readable in Paraview (v5.5) - use HiDEM_load.py macro). In addition to particle positions, the user can decide to include:

 - Particle motion in current timestep ('Displacement')
 - Total particle rotation through simulation ('Rotation')
 - Particle CPU partition (for debugging)

Bond information is stored in two files: \*STR\*.bin files, produced every timestep, and a \*STH\*.bin file, produced once at the start of the simulation. The STH contains the two particle IDs for each bond in the simulation, and is produced only once to save disk space (neither the particle IDs nor the number of bonds change over time). The STR file lists the EFS value (strength) of each bond. Values are usually:

- 0.0 - broken bond
- 0.1 - manually broken bond (porosity)
- EF0 - unbroken bond (default EF0 is 1E9)

Bond locations & strain can be obtained by merging .vtu, STR.bin and STRH.bin files. This is obviously less user friendly than output with:

X,Y,Z,EF0,STRAIN

for each timestep, but it saves a significant amount of disk space.

By default, output is produced every 20,000 timesteps, and in single precision, but both of these can be overridden.

dtop* files - these show the total energy in the system for different parts  

dtop00 - T,WENS,ENMS+ENMS0,KINS,MGHS-MGH0  
dtop01 - T,DPES,DMPENS,PSUMS,GSUMS  
dtopr  - T,system energy, damping energy?  

WENS - elastic energy of the spheres - imagine the particles overlap and are deformed against each other. Then they might bounce back apart.  
ENMS+ENMS0 - elastic deformation energy - the energy held in a deformed/bent system  
MGHS-MGH0 - potential energy  
Kins - translational kinetic energy  
Kins2 - rotational kinetic energy  

DPES,DMPENS - guess energy lost to drag and damping?  
PSUMS - something like pressure  
GSUMS - energy of bed interaction  


## Processing ##

Various scripts for analysing model ouput are in the `scripts/analysis` directory. Many of these rely on the HiDEM python module, located in python/HiDEM/.

The HiDEM python module contains various functions for extracting data from the .vtu, STR*bin and STH*bin files produced by HiDEM.

rc2.f90 computes the size distribution of calved blocks  

size  count  

1  452000
2  4560
3  985
...
largest_block 1

'maxi' is the same as jyr but for the largest intact block (e.g. the remaining glacier)  

rh2.f90 - computes velocity  
rh.f - computes strain  


INFI1 - first JYR  
INFI2 - second JYR  
N - wc -l JYR0001.csv  
max - 10?  

## Paraview ##

First simply load csv, with blank space delimiter, merge delimiters, has no header  
Then apply table to points filter  
Then ensure enable ospray and shadows, and pick point size that makes them touch  

For the sea: add a box, set size and centrepoints  

For the bed: get bed.csv, read it in same as other CSVs  
then apply Delaunay2D filter.  


## TO DO ##

 * Take care of Lost particles in a few places (marked with TODO)

 * BC strategy

 * Translate & Rotate input

### Output Improvements ###

 - Maybe it would be nice to know VDP on each particle? (JYR)
 - Fix the cluster analysis FORTRAN extension

 ## Notes ##

Domain needs to be orientated in XY because:

Boundary conditions are applied in WSY (, WSX?) components (need to compute normal? Ask
